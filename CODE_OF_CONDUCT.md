# Group Code of Conduct
"Devs in Malta" is a group for programmers of all levels, skills, and technologies, irrespective of job title or affiliation to organisations.
It is important that, beyond our skillsets, we are an accepting and empathetic group.

## Our Standards
Being both an online and offline community of creators, it is important that members can feel authentic in both physical and digital spaces, and so we have put together some standards to adhere by. These standards are loosely based on the [Gleam Language Code of Conduct](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which are believed to be both fair and succinct.  

We encourage:
 - Engaging with other's skills, experiences, and interests,
 - Respecting differences in the approaches and viewpoints of others,
 - Providing, and being open to, constructive commentry to and from community members, 
 - Accomodating for others, and the community as a whole.

We have no-tolerance for actions like:
 - Usage of sexually explicit language or imagery,
 - Personal or political harrassment / discrimination,
 - Trolling, spamming, or misleading the group,
 - Acts that reasonably would be seen as unproductive or unprofessional to the nature of the group.

## Upholding of Standards
Though it is the responsibility of Community Leaders and Administrators to uphold the standards of the group, we encourage members to call out behaviour that is inappropriate. 

Members that act in ways that are deemed as inappropriate will be warned, and repetitions of inappropriate actions will result in temporary removal from the group.
Irredeemable actions will result in instant and permanent removal from the group.
