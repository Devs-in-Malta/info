# Community Structure

Although we encourage our community to have a flat structure, it does have leaders that are responsible for administration and actions within the group.

Below are some of our members who help organise the group. 

## Community Founder - Jack Gee

### Profile
> I founded "Devs in Malta" in October of 2024, after moving to Malta in April of 2024 and finding a lack of community run groups for developers on the island.
>
> I have 5 years of commercial experience in Data Science, Engineering, and Analytics; working with various industries to create and maintain big data pipelines for prediction and data-informed decision making.
>
> Before that, I studied Pure Mathematics in my hometown of Exeter, UK. I started programming seriously when working on primality testing / factorisation algorithms, and encapsulating more abstract mathematical ideas into code.
>
> Professionally, my current work focuses mostly on  automation and ETL pipelines in Python. I have been fortunate to work with many types of data including, but not limited to, streaming statistics and userdata, financial reports, and free-text surveys; and many types of technology such as ML / NN, IaC, and Distruted Systems.  
> 
> In my personal work, I am interested in functional languages and functional design. I currently write small apps and websites in Clojure and Gleam. 
>
> Outside of programming, I spend my free time reading, sewing, listening to Japanese Jazz, and learning more about Malta / Maltese Culture!
>
> If you'd like to connect, the best place to find me is Linkedin @ [Jack Gee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-otto-gee/).
>
> I look forward to meeting you at events in the future! ğŸ™‚

### Profile
>After university, I took a 5-year break from software to play drums and promote shows in Birminghamâ€™s local music scene - a world far from tech. But during the pandemic, I fell back in love with coding and found my footing as a developer just before moving to Malta, an island Iâ€™ve visited for 15 years.
>
>As a backend engineer, I currently work with Java and the spring ecosystem, building cloud-native systems with event-driven messaging and Temporal workflows.
>
>Music has stayed close to meâ€”I've recorded a podcast exploring how tech shapes our relationship with music and the real world, and dabbled in full stack web apps, recently enjoying the serverless flexibility of Next.js.
>
>I like to read about topics from anthropology and history to maths and physics (although I'm incredibly novice at the latter). Otherwise you might find me running around Majjistral or dancingÂ inÂ Storeroom.

>You can connect with me on Linkedin @ [Wismko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wismko)
